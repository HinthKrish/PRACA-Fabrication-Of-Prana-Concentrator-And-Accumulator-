# PRACA-Fabrication-Of-Prana-Concentrator-And-Accumulator-
PRACA (Prana Concentrator and Accumulator) is a portable, low-cost oxygen concentrator system designed to support patients with respiratory challenges, especially in remote or emergency healthcare situations.

Objective
To create an efficient, affordable, and scalable oxygen concentrator and storage system that can be rapidly deployed in medical emergencies, contributing to resilient healthcare infrastructure.

ðŸ”§ Features:
Oxygen Concentration System using PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) technology.
Built-in Accumulator to store and supply oxygen during power loss or peak demand.
Compact and Portable design for mobility and emergency use.
Low Power Consumption for rural and low-resource settings.
Easy Maintenance with replaceable filters and modular components.

ðŸ§  Technology Stack:
PSA (Zeolite-based) oxygen generation mechanism.
Microcontroller-based system monitoring.
Sensors for oxygen purity and flow rate detection.
CAD for enclosure and structural design.
Battery backup for uninterrupted supply.

ðŸ“Œ Applications:
Emergency medical support during oxygen crises.
Rural healthcare centers with limited oxygen access.
Mobile medical units and ambulances.
Backup oxygen supply for home healthcare patients.
